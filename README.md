**My project is to examine whether or not the Alabama Department of Environmental Management discriminates in the siting of landfills**
Before starting the spatial analysis, I need to change the scanned PDFs of landfill permits to text files, find the variables I need, and write them to a table.

# Here is what I have done for the project:
1. Download all the 168 permits and rename them;
2. Check which page has the information I need;
3. Run OCR and get the pages I want;
4. Extract the information from the text and write them to a table.
5. Clean the table (haven't finished)

# Here is what I need to do for the project:
# 1. Match the landfill addresses from another database with landfill number I already have;
# 2. Get demographics data;
# 3. Compare the demographics around the landfill to the state average and service area.
