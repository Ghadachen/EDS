April 30, 2015
BFI Waste Systems of Alabama, LLC applied to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management
(ADEM) an application to modify and renew the Solid Waste Disposal Facility Permit for the municipal
solid waste landfill known as the Pineview Sanitary Landfill (Permit 64-11). The modification of the
Pineview Sanitary Landfill will consist of changes to the stormwater management system, drainage
improvements on the final cover system, and updates to the CQA plan. The waste stream for the
Pineview Sanitary Landfill would remain non-hazardous, non-infectious, putrescible and non-putrescible
waste including but not limited to household garbage, industrial waste, commercial solid wastes,
construction and demolition waste, other similar type wastes, and special waste approved by the
Department. The service area for the Pineview Sanitary Landfill would remain Walker, Jefferson,
Shelby, Cullman, Blount, Winston, Fayette, Marion, and Tuscaloosa Counties in the State of Alabama,
and their respective municipalities. The maximum average daily volume of waste disposed at the
Pineview Sanitary Landfill would remain 1,500 tons per day.
Pineview Sanitary Landfill is located in Sections 22, 27, and 28, Township 15 South, Range 5 West, in
Walker County, Alabama. The Pineview Sanitary Landfill consists of 691.48 acres with 169 acres for
disposal.
A public comment period was announced by ADEM on January 22, 2015, and ended on February 26,
2015. The permit application and draft permit was available to the public at the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management. All comments were considered and the appropriate responses have been
prepared.
The Solid Waste Engineering Section has determined that the modification of the stormwater
management system does not comply with ADEM’s Administrative Code Division 13. The removal of
Sedimentation Pond 6 would prevent runoff from the active and/or closed portions of the landfill from
being collected and controlled as outlined in ADEM Administrative Code, r. 335-13-4-.17(2). Therefore,
the Department cannot approve the modification to the stormwater management system. The Solid
Waste Engineering Section has also made the determination that the renewal of the permit and
modifications to final cover system for drainage improvements and updates to the CQA plan within the
application complies with the requirements of ADEM's Administrative Code Division 13 regulations for a
municipal solid waste landfill. Therefore, ADEM approves renewal of the permit and modifications to
the final cover system drainage improvements and updates to the CQA Plan.
